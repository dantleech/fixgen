Fixgen: Database Fixture Generator
==================================

This is a CLI to populate your *database* using the
[Alice](https://github.com/nelmio/alice) fixture generator.

Why?
----

This application populates your *database* directly, without going through any
object models. For this reason it is suited for generating data for legacy
applications or applications which do not use object models.

It doesn't work?
----------------

Nope, this is another side project which I will probably never finish.
